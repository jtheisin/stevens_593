To run hw2.py, simply download the .py file and store it in a location that has python. 
After that, open up a terminal (I use AnacondaPrompt) and navigate to the location where
you stored the file. 

Type python hw2_jtheisin.py  and hit enter to run the file. 
You will be prompted for an input string. 
Type the string and hit enter. 
It will then print out the reverse of the string and if 
the string is a palindrom excluding special chars and numbers
from the palindrom analysis.
